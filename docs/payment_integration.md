## Security Considerations

All payment processing is handled by the respective payment providers. DeGeNz Lounge does not store or process any sensitive payment information.

- All communication with payment providers is encrypted
- Webhook signatures are verified to prevent tampering
- PCI compliance is maintained by using Stripe and PayPal checkout pages

## Testing

For testing purposes, both Stripe and PayPal provide sandbox environments:

- Stripe test mode with test API keys
- PayPal sandbox environment

Test credit cards and PayPal accounts can be used to test the payment flow without real transactions.
